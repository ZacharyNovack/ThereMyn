# ThereMyn
ThereMyn is a digital synthesizer meant to emulate that of a theremin, and was built for the Spring 2019 15-112 Term Project (@ CMU). Additionally, ThereMyn includes customizable waveform and fixed harmonization, as well as loop functionality. 

Though meant to be played with an ultrasonic sensor hooked up to an Arduino Leonardo, ThereMyn can be demoed using the number keys 1-8 to produce pitches. ThereMyn is built in python 2.7 using pyfirmata (for interfacing with the arduino) and pyo (for digital signal processing). ThereMyn won 2nd place at the Spring 2019 15-112 Term Project Showcase.
